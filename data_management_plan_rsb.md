## Explore [DMPTool](dmptool.org)

ANU has organisation account for this, and you can login using uni email. There aren't many people use it in this Uni I think, because when you login you can see other people's data plan from your organisation and I didn't see many. 

__Create a Plan__

I think the main thing you can do with DMPTool is to create plans for your research projects, and there are templates you can choose from. There are templates from various organisations, you can use the one provided by DMPTool or you can also use one from other organisation. I believe it is possible for us to also create templates for different plans. 

__Plan Template__

The template I'm trying is from the Digital Curation Centre (dcc.ac.uk). There are a few sections we need to fill when we create a plan:

* Project Details
    * Here you can fill in informations such as project title, project abstract, research domain, project start/end date, funder, funding status, funding opportunity number, grant number/url. Not sure how these information will be used for, but we will see when I continue exploring. 
* Collaborators 
    * Here you can add project contributors and DMP collaborators. I guess project contributors is just to keep their information, and DMP collaborators can join the plan and read/edit it. You can invite them to join the plan via email. 
* Write Plan
    * Many different sections where you can fill in information about your research plan. The template I use include these sections. 
        * Data collection
        * Documentation and metadata
        * Ethics and legal compliance
        * Storage and backup
        * Selection and preservation
        * Data sharing
        * Responsibilities and resources
    * And under those different sections, you will be asked some questions. For example, I was asked two different questions about how would I collect my data. And for each question, you will have a instruction to explain a little bit about how should you answer the question. 
    * It only let's you write text in here, so it's kind of a document. 
* Research Outputs 
    * Here you can add your expected research output. You can choose the type of the output, such as audio, visual, dataset, image, software, workflow, text etc. 
    * You can also choose intended repositories, you can choose from a list, which seems like different databases people will upload their data to? 
    * You can also add metadata standards, pick access level, initial license etc. 
* Finalise 
    * Set the plan visibility and register plan for a DMP ID.
    * On the website it says with this DMP ID, you can this plan to ORCID, and to project outputs such as datasets and journal artibles which will make it easier to show that you met your funder's requirements by the end of the project. 
* Download 
    * After write everything, you can download it in PDF, CSV, HTML format etc. 
* Follow-up
    * You can change the funding status and add research outputs here. 

__Personal Opinion__

Other than those functions where it can link to data repositories and ORCID etc., I don't think it has more functionalities than a google form or anything like a online form. 

## Explore [ReDBox](redboxresearchdata.com.au)

Their website hasn't been updated since 2018, not sure if we can decide to use this. Seems like UC is using this. 

This version 2 [RedBox - Mint](https://github.com/redbox-mint) seems is being actively developing. 

I read the set up guide and I still couldn't understand how a user can use this. I only see instructions for the backend development. They don't really have a good documentation for user to use, that's probably because they provide subscription. 

I still want to know what it is like to use this redbox as a user. Tried to find some tutorial video I can watch but turns out there is nothing. 

## Data Management Plan for RSB

__Personal Opinion__

The best and easiest way is to get a big tech contractor to do it. Like IBM or Oracle who are extremely good with data. I know it will need a lot of money, I'm just thinking. Of course, they are also not tailored for research,
